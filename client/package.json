  "description": "## Setup 1. First, make sure that you have **Node Package Manager** (npm) installed on your system. To check if you have Node.js installed, run this command in your terminal:`node -v` To confirm that you have npm installed you can run this command in your terminal:`npm -v`. To update your npm, type this into your terminal: `npm install npm@latest -g` 2. Go to the root of the Repository and run `npm install`. Let it    install all the dependencies. 3. Run `npm start` through the terminal. This will start the webserver and the application should pop up in your    browser ready for use. Alternatively you can open in through [http://localhost:3000]. Whenever you make changes in your code and save, the browser will update automatically, so you don't have to click refresh anymore. 4. **IMPORTANT** Our config.js file contains our API Keys which is why we put it in .gitignore.  @team, you can find the config.js file in the Slack channel.    4. Make sure to update the dependencies in the **package.json**. Updating all the dependencies is possble by `npm install <pkg> --save`. It will append the dependencies to your existing **package.json** file.",
